Recommended requirements:

+ CPUs = 64
+ Memory = 256GB

Minimum requirements:

+ CPUs = 16
+ Memory = 48GB

Approximate run time: Variable depending on sequencing modality (targeted or whole genome sequencing), as well as coverage and the individual analyses requested. For instance, a complete analysis of a 60X/30X Tumor/Normal pair with default settings takes approximately 6h 30m using the recommended requirements.

ARM processor support: False
